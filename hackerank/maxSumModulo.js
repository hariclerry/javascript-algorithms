//We define the following:

//A subarray of array a of length  n is a contiguous segment from  a[i]  through  a[j] where .
//The sum of an array is the sum of its elements.
//Given an n element array of integers, a, and an integer, m, determine
//the maximum value of the sum of any of its subarrays modulo m.
//For example, Assume a=[1,2,3] and m=2. The following table lists all subarrays and their moduli:
//		sum	%2
//[1]		1	1
//[2]		2	0
//[3]		3	1
//[1,2]		3	1
//[2,3]		5	1
//[1,2,3]		6	0
